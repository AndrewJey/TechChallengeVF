00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:12.402
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I'm going to present my video defense of
my code.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/39-0
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:20.417
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>In here I use solantex to basically
create the information that goes outside</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/39-1
00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:24.902
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>of the main code,
and I also use Visual Studio.</v>

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:28.522
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>As a point of creation of the whole

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.682
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>To work with the GitHub directly.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/65-0
00:00:33.402 --> 00:00:40.042
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And I also work with visual code for the
web that you guys provide.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/77-0
00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:49.123
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>The website project and I ended up
working on the and I will test it on the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/77-1
00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:49.832
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>PyCharm.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/97-0
00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I also have this database that you may
see I already dropped the table,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/97-1
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.762
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>so if we check for these tables they do
not exist.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/101-0
00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:05.192
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>They are completely empty.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/105-0
00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:08.642
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So we refresh, there's no table.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/108-0
00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:11.302
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And I have here my.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/116-0
00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:16.522
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Coat and we will check basically how this
work.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/126-0
00:01:18.162 --> 00:01:21.682
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I had some hard time trying to get the
information from the PDF.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/143-0
00:01:23.762 --> 00:01:26.718
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But and I work mostly on late night and
early morning.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/143-1
00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:30.642
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So I do have like someone that I could
ask the information at that time.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/166-0
00:01:32.282 --> 00:01:36.497
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Even when I'm doing the video a little
bit later on on on Sunday,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/166-1
00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:39.562
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I work mostly on Saturday and and early
Sunday.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/168-0
00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:42.682
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I'm gonna sleep.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/193-0
00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:51.173
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I had a basic understood that they need
to design and implement a scrapping</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/193-1
00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:56.593
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>system that it's dynamic that all of
files that detect changes and the runs</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/193-2
00:01:56.593 --> 00:01:57.592
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>locally right.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/218-0
00:01:57.632 --> 00:02:04.729
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And I'll way in the computer and also the
DI that we scrap a real website where</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/218-1
00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.672
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>that have origination right and also that
we handle the files and.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/229-0
00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:16.122
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>That it works with the changes that it
have, all the good programming parts.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/244-0
00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:22.472
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And we have Tre conscience and everything.
And they're like, we lock everything so.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/250-0
00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:26.592
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I use a Costa Rican website.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/270-0
00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:32.875
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>That it's called in Puerto Rico and it's
quite hard, this one 'cause it,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/270-1
00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:37.959
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>it's not consistent.
So that makes it more challenging and I</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/270-2
00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:38.792
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>like that.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/297-0
00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.314
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So hey,
I keep using these even when it was</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/297-1
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:44.066
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>harder,
as you may see for example the classing</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/297-2
00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:48.537
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>these cell phone app here and cell phones
because it brings a little bit more</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/297-3
00:02:48.537 --> 00:02:49.512
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>information here.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/302-0
00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:53.362
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It goes with the product.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/309-0
00:02:53.952 --> 00:02:56.552
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Write product key manage product item.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/318-0
00:02:57.962 --> 00:03:02.362
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So it it works with product things like
Title, Center, product item.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/357-0
00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:10.338
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But if we go down here and we check,
these are the phone goes with resolve</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/357-1
00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:16.535
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>content and resolve wrapper so it it
never has like the same class for</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/357-2
00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>everything.
So that make it more interesting.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/357-3
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.962
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So each time it runs it runs and grab
more information but I.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/361-0
00:03:25.962 --> 00:03:28.392
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Couldn't make it all continuously.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/371-0
00:03:29.162 --> 00:03:32.602
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Because I will need more time and I and
the website is not helpful.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/394-0
00:03:33.072 --> 00:03:38.395
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Even though with my code,
if you go to the challenge OK in here</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/394-1
00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:43.552
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>that I do this crap,
you could replace this URL and then add.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/420-0
00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:49.201
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Whatever class name do you want to get to
her and it will capture it and it will,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/420-1
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:52.505
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>you know,
save it in the database and everything so</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/420-2
00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:54.792
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>it works and it works with anything.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/444-0
00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:57.494
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>You could change it and it will have no
issues,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/444-1
00:03:57.494 --> 00:04:02.166
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>but I want to do it with this one that is
harder and I do it with selenium because</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/444-2
00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:04.192
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>it's the tool that I work most with.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/462-0
00:04:04.192 --> 00:04:09.164
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So I I am a little bit more knowledge
with it and besides that website have a</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/462-1
00:04:09.164 --> 00:04:10.312
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>lot of JavaScript.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/469-0
00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:13.642
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Pagination so it it works better with
that.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/471-0
00:04:14.192 --> 00:04:14.312

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/479-0
00:04:16.182 --> 00:04:18.102
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And also I use headlights.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/481-0

00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:18.712
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Documents so.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/583-0
00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:20.802
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>In here.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/592-0
00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:27.482
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>We had the main which the main calls
pretty much everything else.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/605-0
00:05:29.002 --> 00:05:35.042
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And once the mail the main was one by one,
it's called the scrapper.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/622-0
00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:40.411
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And then it goes to the scrap with the
static page which is the one that calls</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/622-1
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:42.042
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>for the for the website.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/650-0
00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:48.658
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Provided and then we also have the
information from the database and I have</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/650-1
00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:52.242
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>also the logs and everything and I I try
with the open AI.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/655-0
00:05:53.632 --> 00:05:53.752
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Llm.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/664-0
00:05:55.152 --> 00:05:59.672
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So there's all the information here.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/666-0
00:05:59.712 --> 00:06:02.392
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>The domain does, but it's mostly.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/668-0
00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:05.282
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>On.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/675-0
00:06:06.812 --> 00:06:07.812
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>On the output right?</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/683-0
00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:11.815
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It's a console app,
so it goes and it checks and it brings</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/683-1
00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:13.172
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>all the information.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/731-0
00:06:14.642 --> 00:06:20.102
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It goes 1 by 1 checking right now this
database that we saw before was empty.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/731-1
00:06:20.102 --> 00:06:25.702
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So the first thing it's going to create
is the information for the database and</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/731-2
00:06:25.702 --> 00:06:31.372
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>then once it created it start trying to
capture the information from the website</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/731-3
00:06:31.372 --> 00:06:33.122
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>and it brings the inform.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/733-0
00:06:33.122 --> 00:06:34.002
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Back.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/740-0
00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:36.472
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>That's pretty much it.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/775-0
00:06:36.472 --> 00:06:39.835
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I mean,
if you don't see to happen anything</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/775-1
00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:45.798
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>'cause it is running on the background
and and it could work directly like on</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/775-2
00:06:45.798 --> 00:06:51.072
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>the PyCharm or or any Idi but if you run
it directly on the console.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/777-0
00:06:54.312 --> 00:06:55.432
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It will also.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/779-0
00:06:56.192 --> 00:06:57.392
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It will also work.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/784-0
00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:04.002
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>There we go.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/794-0
00:07:04.282 --> 00:07:08.442
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I didn't want it to just close and this
is it looking at the.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/801-0
00:07:11.432 --> 00:07:14.232
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>On the local host and checking the
information.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/808-0
00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:21.032
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I didn't want it to to it,
to actually goes.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/814-0
00:07:25.902 --> 00:07:27.262
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And ended by itself.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/821-0
00:07:27.262 --> 00:07:29.182
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And you will see just, you know, a flash.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/832-0
00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:34.548
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So I I keep the press key.
So it depends that you actually press the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/832-1
00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:35.742
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>key to finish it.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/853-0
00:07:37.402 --> 00:07:42.494
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But if you we come here to the database
and then we select that it doesn't have</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/853-1
00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:46.122
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>any brings the error that there's no
relation, etcetera.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/856-0
00:07:47.882 --> 00:07:48.642
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>If we check.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/878-0
00:07:51.192 --> 00:07:57.926
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>You will see there are the cell phones,
them and then we will see there's a well.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/878-1
00:07:57.926 --> 00:08:00.472
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>There's nothing downloaded yet.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/897-0
00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:04.552
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So that's basically why it's empty.
Not because it doesn't worry just because</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/897-1
00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:07.952
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>it doesn't have anything.
But before we saw there were no table.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/908-0
00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:10.872
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Now it says it's just that it doesn't
have anything downloaded.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/925-0
00:08:13.432 --> 00:08:17.678
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>We come here and we refresh and there we
go.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/925-1
00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:22.112
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>We have a sequence and the ID and we have
the.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/931-0
00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:27.392
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Tables already created on the database.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/941-0
00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:34.652
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I also create the scheduler.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/947-0
00:08:35.052 --> 00:08:37.532
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>The scheduler if you run it, it works.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/972-0
00:08:37.532 --> 00:08:41.393
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But I mean,
this is a shared video and if if you want</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/972-1
00:08:41.393 --> 00:08:45.827
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>to to run this share,
you need to wait for a whole hour it to</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/972-2
00:08:45.827 --> 00:08:47.972
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>run again and again and again.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/990-0
00:08:48.332 --> 00:08:54.205
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But it does run and work as you may see.
He's listening and checking the Internet</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/990-1
00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:55.852
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>and everything changes.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1000-0
00:08:57.312 --> 00:09:01.552
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It blocks the information and it start
doing the whole scape.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1002-0
00:09:03.802 --> 00:09:04.042
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Scrape.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1027-0
00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:14.117
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Describe the export is completed.
So in an hour he will do it again.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1027-1
00:09:14.117 --> 00:09:19.512
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I guess my video cannot wait for a whole
hour so I'm trying to be fast as I could.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1036-0
00:09:22.922 --> 00:09:25.482
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Let's see, there's the lock 'cause.
It was required.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1039-0
00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:26.482
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>This is the logger, right?</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1051-0
00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:32.126
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>The logger create the logs and I use the
log to capture pretty much every single</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1051-1
00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:32.962

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1066-0
00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:37.774
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>The file cannot be open because you've
been using another process. OK,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1066-1
00:09:37.774 --> 00:09:39.912
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>but I could check it here no problem.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1074-0
00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:45.672
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So the log logs are the information
provable.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1076-0
00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:47.112
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Umm.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1079-0
00:09:52.372 --> 00:09:53.932
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It brings the information.</v>

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.802
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>you see there's no credential from here.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1103-0
00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:04.432
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Here so it goes in check.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1110-0
00:10:05.392 --> 00:10:07.992
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It works with pretty much.</v>

00:10:12.942 --> 00:10:15.422
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Basically it started creates a log.</v>

00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:31.568
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>'Cause you may see it works.
It tells when everything is going OK and</v>

00:10:31.568 --> 00:10:34.582

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:42.406
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Something I'm thinking now is it's hours
I should definitely have put it hours but</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1169-1
00:10:42.406 --> 00:10:42.822

00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:47.074
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Anyways,
I could do it later then and and then</v>

00:10:47.074 --> 00:10:50.952
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>when you guys check on on the GitHub you

00:10:53.312 --> 00:10:55.992
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Let's see if it allows me to do it from

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1202-0
00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:56.982

00:11:07.912 --> 00:11:11.444
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Also, it's adjacent,
so you could use it like on the website</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1241-1
00:11:11.444 --> 00:11:14.512
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>and if you download any file it will

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1249-0
00:11:16.312 --> 00:11:19.192
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>This was my first Test trying to do

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1254-0
00:11:19.232 --> 00:11:20.472
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It's a dynamic purge.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1263-0
00:11:21.152 --> 00:11:24.632

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1268-0
00:11:24.992 --> 00:11:27.672
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It works theoretically.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1290-0
00:11:27.992 --> 00:11:32.504
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I couldn't test it with my API because
when I put it,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1290-1
00:11:32.504 --> 00:11:39.272
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>it seems that you need to pay to use the

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1292-0
00:11:41.112 --> 00:11:41.432
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>These words.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1294-0
00:11:43.112 --> 00:11:43.232
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1302-0
00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:46.932
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And it selects the information.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1306-0
00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:48.972
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I'm pretty confident at work.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1314-0
00:11:48.972 --> 00:11:51.092
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I try with the one that you guys gave to
me.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1322-0
00:11:51.092 --> 00:11:54.612
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I just change it because the I in this
way I keep it this more dynamically.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1349-0
00:11:56.072 --> 00:12:03.213
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So if you if you do have paid that
support with the secret key,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1349-1
00:12:03.213 --> 00:12:08.792
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>you just put it on the on the environment,
right?</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1354-0
00:12:10.352 --> 00:12:11.672
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>For the environmental.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1360-0
00:12:13.402 --> 00:12:16.842
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Values and then it will self fill and
will work.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1384-0
00:12:18.352 --> 00:12:22.652
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So I create this one with the one that
the company provided.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1384-1
00:12:22.652 --> 00:12:27.728
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I have here the API and I have,
you know the whole endpoint and the and</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1384-2
00:12:27.728 --> 00:12:29.632
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>the key and this one works.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1391-0
00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:31.872
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It's a little bit more codeborned.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1400-0
00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:36.152
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>You know, I hard code most of it,
but it's pretty much the same idea.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1409-0
00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:42.720
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It comes and brings the idea of what it
requires and what way it's gonna do the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1409-1
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.232
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>things.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1413-0
00:12:44.462 --> 00:12:46.662
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Asking to shut TPT.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1423-0
00:12:48.952 --> 00:12:52.338
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>What?
What is the best option to do with the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1423-1
00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:53.392
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>CSS and stuff?</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1443-0
00:12:53.832 --> 00:12:57.511
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>This is my database.
I didn't want to use environmental for</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1443-1
00:12:57.511 --> 00:13:01.312
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>the database because I think it's a
little bit more exposure.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1455-0
00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:08.730
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So I had a folder here called Docs where
I had a txt which is also omitted from</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1455-1
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.472
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>the git.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1475-0
00:13:11.062 --> 00:13:15.562
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>That you add your information from the
database on a TV credentials and it</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1475-1
00:13:15.562 --> 00:13:16.462
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>actually works.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1493-0
00:13:16.582 --> 00:13:21.914
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I had requirements in selenium here for
the reason I use selenium because I this</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1493-1
00:13:21.914 --> 00:13:26.982
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>is where I play lays the dogs that I was
working with all the documentation.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1501-0
00:13:28.472 --> 00:13:32.192
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But the idea is to just keep it.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1520-0
00:13:33.952 --> 00:13:39.105
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Where I could edit it and upload it to

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1520-1
00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:44.112
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>everything was ready I moved them to

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1529-0
00:13:44.382 --> 00:13:47.142
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Or the environmentals right?</v>

00:13:47.142 --> 00:13:51.022

00:13:51.982 --> 00:13:53.702
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I add them where they belong.</v>

00:13:55.832 --> 00:13:58.592
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Well,

<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>web project that you guys.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1683-0
00:15:03.182 --> 00:15:05.982
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Provide so instead of actually changing
something.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1685-0
00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:08.072
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>A.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1701-0
00:15:08.072 --> 00:15:14.699
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Create AAPI the works with the Jason
files that I had up here and it basically</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1701-1
00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:16.712
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>creates routes you know.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1720-0
00:15:18.472 --> 00:15:25.682
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It goes to the URL and at A and at the
Ure to actually display the information.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1720-1
00:15:25.682 --> 00:15:25.952
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1728-0
00:15:27.632 --> 00:15:30.432
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It it basically goes and jumps inside on
the same.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1739-0
00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:37.952
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Local host and it works and reads the the
website and then.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1756-0
00:15:39.432 --> 00:15:45.432
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It replaced the information that is being
shown with whatever URL I send.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1775-0
00:15:45.512 --> 00:15:48.696
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It actually works,
but you need to hide it on the same</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1775-1
00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:52.632
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>project and you need to have the right
information of the solution.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1782-0
00:15:52.712 --> 00:15:54.912
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So it was, you know, something extra.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1798-0
00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:58.142
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I had it there,
but I I didn't want to to screw up</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1798-1
00:15:58.142 --> 00:16:01.847
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>something. So at the end,
even when it was kind of working,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1798-2
00:16:01.847 --> 00:16:02.712
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I didn't want.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1800-0
00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:03.502
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>2.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1836-0
00:16:04.262 --> 00:16:09.597
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>To Ru my my thing so I I take it outside
so it it will actually crop up.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1836-1
00:16:09.597 --> 00:16:15.006
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It will actually take down everything
here because if it's outside of the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1836-2
00:16:15.006 --> 00:16:18.222
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>website project.
But if the API is working.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1852-0
00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:24.195
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So if you add it on the website project,
it reads the whole the whole website</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1852-1
00:16:24.195 --> 00:16:27.182
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>project and then it mimics the website.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1864-0
00:16:27.182 --> 00:16:32.331
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But I could add the thing that I want
through this API so it looks like the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1864-1
00:16:32.331 --> 00:16:33.822
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>website but it is not.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1866-0
00:16:34.822 --> 00:16:35.582
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Wishes.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1875-0
00:16:37.222 --> 00:16:39.982
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It sounds interesting now that I said it
loud.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1898-0
00:16:41.512 --> 00:16:46.505
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And hear you as you see if you move down
the API just can'takes everything back to</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1898-1
00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:49.032
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>order because it's on a local host, right?</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1930-0
00:16:49.032 --> 00:16:54.272
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>If we had two different URLs it it should,
it will not fail.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1930-1
00:16:54.272 --> 00:17:00.971
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It will actually work together and we
could have the same the Dominion and in</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1930-2
00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:05.352
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>that Dominion just change the the end of
the Yuri.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1951-0
00:17:06.342 --> 00:17:12.107
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I have the generic results Jason file
which is basically to check that all the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1951-1
00:17:12.107 --> 00:17:17.142
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>things work and this is also the the file
that I wanted to to check.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1976-0
00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:24.855
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>To check not only to check the errors,
but also to to upload the information to</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1976-1
00:17:24.855 --> 00:17:28.935
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>to the website and if you download
something from the website it will</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1976-2
00:17:28.935 --> 00:17:30.392
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>capture and generate the.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1999-0
00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:37.114
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>The information I have here dogs which
basically you re you required from here</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1999-1
00:17:37.114 --> 00:17:40.744
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>the requirements and create your own DV
credentials.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/1999-2
00:17:40.744 --> 00:17:43.142
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>The data just for testing purposes.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2010-0
00:17:43.542 --> 00:17:50.062
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I have the chat TPT connection,
the logger that it logs the information.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2025-0
00:17:51.462 --> 00:17:57.622
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>And then I have a database connection
that it works if you may see already.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2037-0
00:17:59.032 --> 00:18:02.392
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>It's called, what else we're naming,
so I don't want to take long.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2047-0
00:18:02.392 --> 00:18:06.592
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I guess you guys will check the the work
directly.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2058-0
00:18:06.592 --> 00:18:10.561
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I tried to Add all the commentaries of
everything I do,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2058-1
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:13.112
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>try to make it as clear as possible.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2073-0
00:18:13.112 --> 00:18:17.695
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I know my logic is sometimes entangled
and I create things that goes together</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2073-1
00:18:17.695 --> 00:18:19.752
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>and that's how I started with that.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2114-0
00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:27.261
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Take challenge project and then it moved
to a scrapper that goes static because I</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2114-1
00:18:27.261 --> 00:18:33.016
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>now have a dynamic static and then I
start thinking what could I do more and</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2114-2
00:18:33.016 --> 00:18:38.771
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>and then I had a scheduler and then I
start creating something else like the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2114-3
00:18:38.771 --> 00:18:39.892
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>API and so for.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2125-0
00:18:39.892 --> 00:18:42.172
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Connecting everything I create a new main.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2128-0
00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:43.452
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So at the very end.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2140-0
00:18:44.662 --> 00:18:47.942
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>If I have more time,
I keep adding stuff I was selling.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2178-0
00:18:49.512 --> 00:18:56.888
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Earlier that on on linking that if I had
more time I will even do the UML for for</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2178-1
00:18:56.888 --> 00:19:00.936
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>the classes and I will also do the
database,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2178-2
00:19:00.936 --> 00:19:07.592
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>UML and the and the competence UML which
will look better than the right.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2184-0
00:19:10.672 --> 00:19:13.152
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But it's basically the idea that.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2200-0
00:19:14.672 --> 00:19:18.752
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I keep adding stuff if you if you.
If you love me, I keep adding stuff.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2203-0
00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:21.872
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I I start thinking like what?</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2217-0
00:19:21.872 --> 00:19:26.752
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>What could I make this better or what
could I do to make this even look better?</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2227-0
00:19:28.392 --> 00:19:30.952
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So I also had that you may see on the
project the the PDF.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2251-0
00:19:33.352 --> 00:19:39.053
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I tried to take pretty much everything in
here and and check it and go like check,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2251-1
00:19:39.053 --> 00:19:42.694
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>check, check.
I was willing to do the Azure function</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2251-2
00:19:42.694 --> 00:19:43.312
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>which is.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2298-0
00:19:43.662 --> 00:19:48.285
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Quite easy honestly,
but I I mean I should functions.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2298-1
00:19:48.285 --> 00:19:55.135
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I need to be paid and I'm using my my
free account that come from my university</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2298-2
00:19:55.135 --> 00:20:00.871
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>for my teaching classes,
so I cannot spend more this month if this</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2298-3
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:05.152
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>interview was the next one I had,
you know, save.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2312-0
00:20:05.222 --> 00:20:09.945
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Money so I could use the the Azure
function but I I have already spent the</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2312-1
00:20:09.945 --> 00:20:12.968
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>money,
the free money that I should provide for</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2312-2
00:20:12.968 --> 00:20:14.102
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>teaching purposes.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2340-0
00:20:15.602 --> 00:20:20.189
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I mean also using some of these
recommendations up here will be easier,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2340-1
00:20:20.189 --> 00:20:23.374
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>but as you may see that website was quite
crappy,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2340-2
00:20:23.374 --> 00:20:27.642
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>so that's what I like because it becomes
more more hard challenge.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2352-0
00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:32.622
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So yeah, I mean, I tried the bonus.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2361-0
00:20:32.622 --> 00:20:35.782
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I tried the resilience with all the error
handling.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2364-0
00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:38.422
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>There's a big bunch of.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2368-0
00:20:40.102 --> 00:20:41.782
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>There's a big bunch of.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2370-0
00:20:43.092 --> 00:20:43.892
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Of.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2376-0
00:20:47.282 --> 00:20:50.382
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Ah try catch, try catch everywhere.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2399-0
00:20:50.992 --> 00:20:55.138
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So you will be seeing a a lot of them
'cause I I mean it,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2399-1
00:20:55.138 --> 00:20:58.712
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>it's great for checking code every in
everything.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2415-0
00:20:58.712 --> 00:21:04.870
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>So I had a try here and had a very thing
and an inception as you go to the main</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2415-1
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.872
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>class the the old one.
If you go to the main class.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2418-0
00:21:10.382 --> 00:21:11.302
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>You will see.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2453-0
00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:17.405
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>A lot of try catch in the code.
Even try catch inside of the try catch so</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2453-1
00:21:17.405 --> 00:21:21.981
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>it will bring you something else and then
exceptions could finalization of what</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2453-2
00:21:21.981 --> 00:21:26.214
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>whatever is working loggers the logs
every single thing it does and I try</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2453-3
00:21:26.214 --> 00:21:28.102
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>catch exception in the same name.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2460-0
00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:32.332
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>That checks if everything is is being
pressed and done.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2480-0
00:21:34.142 --> 00:21:36.915
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>This is because there was originally the
main,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2480-1
00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:39.982
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>so if I screw up something I didn't want
to add it.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2485-0
00:21:39.982 --> 00:21:41.422
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>But this is a removable file right now.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2502-0
00:21:42.372 --> 00:21:45.274
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>As you may see,
the was originally the Big Mans and</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2502-1
00:21:45.274 --> 00:21:46.892
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>everything was handling here.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2508-0
00:21:46.892 --> 00:21:50.252
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Then I moved to my new main which is
called Main.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2518-0
00:21:51.902 --> 00:21:55.262
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>They've become the dynamic scropper and
same here with the.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2530-0
00:21:57.732 --> 00:22:00.892
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>Chattanooga one that you could add
yourself,</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2530-1
00:22:00.892 --> 00:22:04.052
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>and this is the one provided by the

00:22:07.862 --> 00:22:08.902
<v Andr&#233;s J. Jim&#233;nez Leandro (McAFamily)>I think that's it.</v>

401ffde7-6b2c-4e8c-ab4d-9711a5fa7602/2540-0
00:22:08.902 --> 00:22:10.262

00:22:15.652 --> 00:22:16.252
